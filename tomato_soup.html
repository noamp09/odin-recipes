            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick sticks</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, peeled</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
